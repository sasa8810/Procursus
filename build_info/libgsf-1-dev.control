Description: Structured File Library - development files
 This package contains the development files used in building applications
 that use the GNOME Structured File Library.
 .
 The GNOME Structured File Library aims to provide an efficient
 extensible I/O abstraction for dealing with different structured file
 formats. It is actively being developed and its API is still likely to
 undergo significant changes (in particular, extensions).
